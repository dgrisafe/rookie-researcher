  abstract = {This study examines associations between two measures of impulsivity and brain response to alcohol taste cues. Impulsivity is both a risk factor for and a consequence of alcohol use and misuse. Frontostriatal circuits are linked to both impulsivity and addiction-related behaviors, including response to alcohol cues. Non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers (n\,=\,55) completed (i) an fMRI alcohol taste cue-reactivity paradigm; (ii) the monetary choice questionnaire (MCQ), a measure of choice impulsivity where participants choose between smaller, sooner rewards and larger, delayed rewards; (iii) and the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, a self-report measure assessing five impulsivity factors. General linear models identified associations between neural alcohol taste cue-reactivity and impulsivity, adjusting for age, gender, and smoking status. Self-reported sensation seeking was positively associated with alcohol taste cue-elicited activation in frontostriatal regions, such that individuals who reported higher sensation seeking displayed greater neural response to alcohol taste cues. Conversely, delay discounting was negatively associated with activation in frontoparietal regions, such that individuals who reported greater discounting showed less cue-elicited activation. There were no significant associations between other self-reported impulsivity subscales and alcohol taste cue-reactivity. These results indicate that sensation seeking is associated with reward responsivity, while delay discounting is associated with recruitment of self-control circuitry.},

It is intended to supersede the need to obtain blood alcohol levels (BALs) when performed in conjunction with the screening of potential alcohol withdrawal. While used to test intoxication, it is not meant as an exact comparison to a breath/blood alcohol test, but rather, to aid in clinical decisions regarding a patient. The test should be completed on all patients that are clinically intoxicated (and/or provide history of recent alcohol). This should be repeated as needed until the HII is less than four. Blood or breath alcohol testing is not required for medical clearance, unless otherwise clinically indicated. Currently, we advise clinicians to use their best judgement when assessing sobriety of patients under the influence of non-alcohol substances, including, but not limited to, the Hack's Impairment Index.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emergency Departments (EDs) care for thousands of alcohol-intoxicated patients annually. No clinically relevant bedside measures currently exist to describe degree of impairment. OBJECTIVES: To assess a group of bedside tests ("Hack's Impairment Index [HII] score") that applies a numerical value to the degree of alcohol-induced impairment in ED patients. METHODS: A six-month retrospective review of HII score data was performed in a convenience sample of 293 intoxicated ED patients. Patients were scored 0-4 on five tasks, divided by the maximum score (20 if all tasks completed), every 2 hours; and classified by the number of visits: Low-frequency (1 visit); Medium-frequency (2 visits); High-frequency ({$\geq$}3 visits). Correlations were assessed between HII score, healthcare provider judgment of intoxication, and measured alcohol levels. RESULTS: Study patients had 513 visits; 236 were low-frequency, 26 middle-frequency and 31 high-frequency. Clinical assessment and HII score were strongly correlated (Spearman's rho\,=\,0.82, p\,{$<<$}\,0.001); clinical assessment and alcohol level less strongly so (rho\,=\,0.49, p\,{$<<$}\,0.001). Among low-frequency patients, HII score and alcohol level were weakly correlated (r\,=\,0.324, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), with no such correlation among high-frequency visitors (r\,=\,-0.04, p\,=\,0.89). The mean decline between serial HII scores was 0.126 (95\% CI: 0.098-0.154). CONCLUSION: This pilot study shows the HII score can be performed at the bedside of alcohol-intoxicated patients. The HII declines in a reasonably predictable manner over time; and applies a quantitative, objective assessment of alcohol impairment.},

  abstract = {BackgroundOver 35 million alcohol-impaired (AI) patients are cared for in emergency departments (EDs) annually. Emergency physicians are charged with ensuring AI patients' safety by identifying resolution of alcohol-induced impairment. The most common standard evaluation is an extemporized clinical examination, as ethanol levels are not reliable or predictive of clinical symptoms. There is no standard assessment of ED AI patients.ObjectiveThe objective was to evaluate a novel standardized ED assessment of alcohol impairment, Hack's Impairment Index (HII score), in a busy urban ED.MethodsA retrospective chart review was performed for all AI patients seen in our busy urban ED over 24 months. Trained nurses evaluated AI patients with both "usual" and HII score every 2~hours. Patients were stratified by frequency of visits for AI during this time: high ({$\geq$} 6), medium (2-5), and low (1). Within each category, comparisons were made between HII scores, measured ethanol levels, and usual nursing assessment of AI. Changes in HII scores over time were also evaluated.ResultsA total of 8,074 visits from 3,219 unique patients were eligible for study, including 7,973 (98.7\%) with ethanol levels, 5,061 (62.7\%) with complete HII scores, and 3,646 (45.2\%) with health care provider assessments. Correlations between HII scores and ethanol levels were poor (Pearson's R2 ~=~0.09, 0.09, and 0.17 for high-, medium-, and low-frequency strata). HII scores were excellent at discriminating nursing assessment of AI, while ethanol levels were less effective. Omitting extrema, HII scores fell consistently an average 0.062 points per hour, throughout patients' visits.ConclusionsThe HII score applied a quantitative, objective assessment of alcohol impairment. HII scores were superior to ethanol levels as an objective clinical measure of impairment. The HII declines in a reasonably predictable manner over time, with serial evaluations corresponding well with health care provider evaluations.},

  abstract = {Convincing evidence links aberrant B-vitamin dependent hepatic methionine metabolism to the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). This review focuses on the essential roles of folate and vitamins B6 and B12 in hepatic methionine metabolism, the causes of their deficiencies among chronic alcoholic persons, and how their deficiencies together with chronic alcohol exposure impact on aberrant methionine metabolism in the pathogenesis of ALD. Folate is the dietary transmethylation donor for the production of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which is the substrate for all methyltransferases that regulate gene expressions in pathways of liver injury, as well as a regulator of the transsulfuration pathway that is essential for production of glutathione (GSH), the principal antioxidant for defense against oxidative liver injury. Vitamin B12 regulates transmethylation reactions for SAM production and vitamin B6 regulates transsulfuration reactions for GSH production. Folate deficiency accelerates the experimental development of ALD in ethanol-fed animals while reducing liver SAM levels with resultant abnormal gene expression and decreased production of antioxidant GSH. Through its effects on folate metabolism, reduced SAM also impairs nucleotide balance with resultant increased DNA strand breaks, oxidation, hepatocellular apoptosis, and risk of carcinogenesis. The review encompasses referenced studies on mechanisms for perturbations of methionine metabolism in ALD, evidence for altered gene expressions and their epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of ALD, and clinical studies on potential prevention and treatment of ALD by correction of methionine metabolism with SAM.},

The purpose of this study was to assess current practice and opinion among UK physicians. Questionnaires were completed by a total of 427 physicians comprising Accident and Emergency (A\&E) specialists and psychiatrists, with a response rate of 25\%. The main findings were that vitamin deficiency was perceived as being uncommon amongst alcohol misusers ({$<$}25\%) and there was no consensus as to which B vitamins are beneficial in treatment or the best method of administration of B-vitamin supplementation. The majority of psychiatrists favoured oral administration for prophylaxis against the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in chronic alcohol misusers and parenteral therapy in patients with signs of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Whilst only just over half the A\&E specialists expressed a preference, most favoured parenteral therapy in both cases. Most respondents did not currently have a unit policy/protocol on the management of vitamin supplementation in chronic alcohol misusers. Overall, the findings suggest that there is wide variation in current practice and highlight the need for guidelines in this area.},

  abstract = {A toxic effect of alcohol is the principal cause of the development of liver disease in alcoholism. Fatty infiltration of the liver is a consequence of  ethanol metabolism due mainly to an increased synthesis and decreased degradation  of fatty acids. Mechanisms that have been suggested for ethanol-induced  hepatocellular necrosis include centrolobular hypoxia due to an increased oxygen  requirement and intracellular accumulation of protein, fat, and water which  results in increased cell size. Hepatocellular necrosis, however, may not be a  necessary stage in the development of cirrhosis. Chronic ethanol administration  increases hepatic collagen deposition, and acute and chronic ethanol  administration inhibit liver cell regeneration. Increased humoral and cellular  immunological activity to liver tissue and its components may contribute to the  persistence of liver disease in the alcoholic. However, only a small proportion  of alcoholics and baboons fed alcohol develop cirrhosis, suggesting that other  factors, either genetic, environmental, or nutritional, play a role. Malnutrition  is common in alcoholics. Liver disease is more common in some malnourished  populations, and has been produced by nutrient deficiencies. Decreased dietary  intake, as well as malabsorption and alterations in the metabolism of nutrients,  are causes of nutrient deficiencies in alcoholism. Some of the effects of alcohol  on the liver may be mediated by its actions on nutrient absorption and  metabolism.},
