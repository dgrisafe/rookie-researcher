# Terminal in RStudio

The Terminal is the control center of your computer. 

It is usually accessed from outside *RStudio* as a separate program. But it is conveniently rolled into *RStudio*.

There are several operating software for the Terminal *Shell*, including Bash, Zsh, OhMyZsh.

Zsh has improved functionality over the predecessor Bash. I prefer the Zsh shell language when I use the Terminal.

But the Terminal in *RStudio* comes default as Bash. 

The Zsh language can be set as default by selecting from the *Tools* dropdown menu:

*Tools → Global Options*

In the *Options* window, select the *Terminal* tab.

*General → Shell → New terminals open with:* 

Select the dropdown menu for *Bash* and change it to *Zsh*
