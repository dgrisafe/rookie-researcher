# Data Science Workflow

I completed three data science projects for my doctoral dissertation in epidemiology. I developed my personal workflow for projects in academic clinical research. The consistency allows me to locate files efficiently at any stage of the project.

0. Data
1. Programs
2. Media
3. Reports
4. Discussions
5. Drafts
6. Talks

Throughout all of the above folders I name files with the prefix YYYYMMDD. For example `20230130 Data Science Workflow.md` would be the name of this file on my local machine.


## 0 Data

This is a data folder. This may vary, as often data was protected in a database that I used permissions to access. But this was a great place to store publicly available data.


## 1 Programs

I keep my R scripts in this folder. I like to have one R Markdown (RMd) script for data wrangling/cleaning and another RMd for analysis. I would also "abstract" or separate chunks of R code into separate .R files that I would then run from within the RMd files using the function `source()`.


## 2 Media

Sometime I had to include images or other media in a report. Keeping media files in a separate folder was useful when I went back to create a presentation towards the end of a project.


## 3 Reports

I use R markdown files often to generate PDF and HTML reports that I showed collaborators during meetings and internal presentations. Keeping them organized here allowed me to explain my work in a pinch during meetings.


## 4 Discussions

I take notes during project meetings in MS Word. I often would reference these meetings while working on my code.


## 5 Drafts

This is where I would write manuscripts that I would eventually submit to a journal.

## 6 Talks

I had to give formal and informal talks on my presentations throughout the life of a project. I usually would use Google Slides for ease of access. I also often used [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) to produce shortened, custom HTML addresses for a talk that I could easily and quickly share with others.
