# Data Science Workflow

I completed three data science projects for my doctoral dissertation in epidemiology. During this time I developed my personal workflow for projects in academic clinical research. The consistency allows me to locate files efficiently at any stage of the project.

Whenever I start a new project I create seven empty folders with the following names:

* `0 Data`
* `1 Programs`
* `2 Media`
* `3 Reports`
* `4 Discussions`
* `5 Drafts`
* `6 Talks`

Throughout all of the above folders I name files with the prefix `YYYYMMDD`. For example `20230130 Data Science Workflow.md` would be the name of this file on my local machine.


## `0 Data`

This data folder has varying utility, as often data is protected in a database that requires special permissions to access. This is a great place to store publicly available data.


## `1 Programs`

I keep my R scripts in this folder. I like to have one R Markdown (RMd) file for data wrangling/cleaning and another RMd for analysis. I also "abstract" or separate chunks of R code into individual .R files that I run from within the RMd files using the function `source()`.  


## `2 Media`

Sometimes I include images or other media in a report. Keeping media files in a separate folder is useful when creating a presentation towards the end of a project.  


## `3 Reports`

I use R markdown files often to generate PDF and HTML reports that I share with collaborators during meetings and internal presentations. Keeping them organized here allows me to access them while communicating my work during meetings.


## `4 Discussions`

I take notes during project meetings in MS Word. I often reference these meetings later while working on my code.


## `5 Drafts`

This is where I keep manuscripts that I eventually plan on publishing in a journal.


## `6 Talks`

I give formal and informal presentations throughout the life of a project. I usually use Google Slides for ease of access. I also often use [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) to produce shortened, custom HTML addresses for a talk that I can quickly share with others.
