# Git and GitHub

Git and GitHub are used often in programming.

More has been written on these topics than I ever could. Here are some great resources to start using Git in R.

Bartlett provides a high level introduction to Git and GitHub aimed at a non-programmer. She explains how Git is useful for:

> 1. Telling the story of your project
> 2. Traveling back in time
> 3. Experimenting with changes
> 4. Backing up your work
> 5. Collaborating on projects

She notes that jargon in Git makes it inaccessible to new users. She provides this excellent summary of Git terminology.

> | Git Jargon | Definition |
> |----------|------------|
> | Repository | your project folder |
> | Commit | a snapshot of your repo |
> | Hash | an id for a commit |
> | Checkout | time travel to a specific commit |
> | Branch | a movable label that points to a commit |
> | Merge | combining two branches |
> | Remote | a computer with the repository on it |
> | Clone | get the repository from the remote for the first time |
> | Push | send commits to a remote |
> | Pull | get commits from a remote |

## How to Use Git/GitHub with R

Getting started with Git in R has a bit of a learning curve. There are some nuts-and-bolts that must be tended to before integrating Git with R. Thankfully Dave has posted an excellent walkthrough for Git in RStudio that covers the following:

* Installing Git
* Configuring Git
* Initializing a Git Repository
* Viewing Commit History
* Making a Commit and Viewing More History
* Connecting RStudio and GitHub
* Signing Up for GitHub
* Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) on GitHub
* Storing Personal Access Token to Connect RStudio and GitHub
* Connecting RStudio Projects with GitHub Repositories
  * RStudio First
  * GitHub First
* General Workflow
  * Push
  * Pull
